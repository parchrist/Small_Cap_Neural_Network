# Small_Cap_Neural_Network
LTSM Nerual Network with the intent of tracking and prediciting one of the most volitile "sectors" a person could trade. 


The Penny stock sector of the Stock market has been known to be one of the hardest to trade. The overall market is diluted with companies looking to exersize warrants, mid day IPOS, and other market miniplation tactics. The LTSM Neural network in this repo should be used as a tool to understand the process in which the small cap sector will move intra day. Below I will show some of the charts that the small cap sector which show clear signs of miniplation.![AJRD_2020-12-21](https://github.com/parchrist/Small_Cap_Neural_Network/assets/108627999/28b68ba4-9ad0-428c-a339-491e3b498f72)

This is an IPO right before the market open.

This is a warrant execution right at market open.

This is also a IPO right before market open. 

Some of the examples in the data set are even worse, and the charts are only made so I know which tickers are deemed the "black swan"(outlier) so I know to remove them. 

This Neural Network will take some time, I have over 30,000 examples that I need to go through and catagorize, and building the network with even more data is going to take a bigger computer.
